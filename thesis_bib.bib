	abstract = {By using high-resolution low-scan-rate all-sky {CCD} cameras, the {SPanish} Meteor Network ({SPMN}) detected an outburst of Orionid meteors associated with comet 1P/Halley on 2006 October 20–21. This detection was made possible due to the operational concept of the {SPMN} that involves continuous monitoring of meteor activity throughout the year. Accurate heliocentric orbits have been obtained for three meteors imaged simultaneously from two stations during the outburst. Additional astrometry of 33 single-station meteors indicates that the activity was produced from a conspicuous geocentric radiant located at α= 922 ± 05 and δ=+154 ± 06 which is similar to the radiant observed during the 1993 Orionid outburst despite the fact that the last one peaked on a different date. The radiant position obtained by the {SPMN} is consistent with that derived from digital pictures taken a few hours before from Ankara (Turkey). The extent of the outburst (a background of bright meteors was observed over several days), its absence in other years, and the orbital period of the three Orionid orbits suggest that the outburst could be produced by meteoroids trapped in resonances with Jupiter but additional data are required. The {SPMN}'s continuous coverage of meteor activity allowed the identification of the main sources of meteors during 2006 October: mostly due to the Orionid stream, the two branches of the Taurid stream associated with comet 2P/Encke, and the δ Aurigids. Surprisingly, once a detailed analysis of the double-station video meteors was completed, some additional minor stream activity was discovered, that is, the ν Aurigids. In consequence, we also present two accurate orbits of this unexpected, but previously identified, minor shower.},

	abstract = {First results are presented from a newly developed meteoroid orbit survey, called {CAMS} – Cameras for Allsky Meteor Surveillance, which combines meteor detection algorithms for low-light video observations with traditional video surveillance tools. Sixty video cameras at three stations monitor the sky above 31° elevation. Goal of {CAMS} is to verify meteor showers in search of their parent comets among newly discovered near-Earth objects. This paper outlines the concept of operations, the hardware, and software methods used during operation and in the data reduction pipeline, and accompanies the data release of the first batch of meteoroid orbits. During the month of November 2010, 2169 precisely reduced meteoroid trajectories from 17 nights have an error in the apparent radiant of the trajectory {\textless}2° and error in speed {\textless}10\%. Median values of the error are 0.31° and 0.53km/s, respectively, sufficient to resolve the intrinsic dispersion of annual meteor showers and resolve minor showers from the sporadic background. The limiting visual magnitude of the cameras is +5.4, recording meteors of +4 magnitude and brighter, bright enough to stand out from the mostly fainter sporadic meteors detected as under dense radar echoes. {CAMS} readily detected all established showers (6) active during the clear nights in November. Of the showers that needed confirmation, we confirm the theta Aurigids ({THA}, {IAU}\#390), the chi Taurids ({CTA}, {IAU}\#388), and the omicron Eridanids ({OER}, {IAU}\#338). We conclude that the iota November Aurigids ({IAR}, {IAU}\#248) are in fact the combined activity of the theta Aurigids and chi Taurids, and this shower should be dismissed from the list. Finally, there is also a clustering consistent with the zeta Cancrids ({ZCN}, {IAU}\#243), but we cannot exclude that this is lower perihelion dust belonging to the Orionid shower. Data are submitted to the {IAU} Meteor Data Center on a semi-regular basis, and can be accessed also at http://cams.seti.org.},

	abstract = {Fireballs are bright objects caused when meteoroids burn up in the Earth's atmosphere. The use of all-sky cameras has become a notable method for amateur astronomers to gather and analyze fireball data. The primary goal of our all-sky camera was to be able to identify and record fireballs in an outdoor environment. This project focused on completing a build of an all-sky camera system and creating the supporting analysis software. We completed the majority of our initial build goals. However, there are still improvements that need to be made in order for our project to be self-contained. Our build primarily differs from previous all-sky camera builds through the use of a Raspberry Pi for onboard processing. Once we were content with our build and our software, we were able to collect 30 hours of data and detect 10 potential fireballs from the rooftop of Collins Science Building at Willamette University. Extensions to this project include understanding how many fireballs occur each night, their size, and where they are coming from. In order to do this, the videos that we extract will need to be analyzed for the number of events we are seeing, distribution of observed fireball location, and brightness. Completing each of these steps will allow for more efficient fireball monitoring, allowing for greater datasets to be gathered for better statistical population analysis.},

	abstract = {{NASA}’s future human space exploration strategy includes single and multi-launch missions to various
destinations including cis-lunar space, near Earth objects such
as asteroids, and ultimately Mars. Each campaign is being
defined by Design Reference Missions ({DRMs}). Many of these
missions are complex, requiring multiple launches and
assembly of vehicles in orbit. Certain missions also have
constrained departure windows to the destination. These
factors raise concerns regarding the reliability of launching
and assembling all required elements in time to support
planned departure. This paper describes an integrated
methodology for analyzing launch and assembly reliability in
any single {DRM} or set of {DRMs} starting with flight hardware
manufacturing and ending with final departure to the
destination. A discrete event simulation is built for each {DRM}
that includes the pertinent risk factors including, but not
limited to: manufacturing completion; ground transportation;
ground processing; launch countdown; ascent; rendezvous and
docking, assembly, and orbital operations leading up to transdestination-injection.
Each reliability factor can be selectively
activated or deactivated so that the most critical risk factors
can be identified. This enables {NASA} to prioritize mitigation
actions so as to improve mission success.},

Nine fragments were found within three months of the fall with a total mass of 4.58 kg. The ellipse of fall is unusually small because of the steep path in the atmosphere. The photograph from the Vegreville station reveals six trails below 26 km and these are correlated with the six main fragments, all with masses in excess of 300 g. A photometric study indicates that Innisfree had a peak absolute magnitude Mpan = −12.1 at a height of 36 km. The recovered meteorites provide known masses for the late stages of the photographic trails which, combined with dynamical data, allow luminous efficiencies to be derived with unusual confidence. Late in the flight where shock wave effects dominate ablation, luminous efficiencies vary from 3 × 10−5 to 5 × 10−2 for velocities between 3 and 10 km s−1 and masses from 0.3 to 2.0 kg. The mean luminous efficiency for the entire flight is estimated between 4 × 10−2 and 8 × 10−2.},

One of the goals of these networks is to provide the necessary information for linking meteorites to their pre-impact, heliocentric orbits and ultimately to their source regions in the solar system. We re-compute heliocentric orbits for the 25 meteorite falls published to date from original data sources. Using these orbits, we constrain their most likely escape routes from the main asteroid belt and the cometary region by utilizing a state-of-the-art orbit model of the near-Earth-object population, which includes a size-dependence in delivery efficiency. While we find that our general results for escape routes are comparable to previous work, the role of trajectory measurement uncertainty in escape-route identification is explored for the first time. Moreover, our improved size-dependent delivery model substantially changes likely escape routes for several meteorite falls, most notably Tagish Lake which seems unlikely to have originated in the outer main belt as previously suggested. We find that reducing the uncertainty of fireball velocity measurements below  ∼ 0.1 km/s does not lead to reduced uncertainties in the identification of their escape routes from the asteroid belt and, further, their ultimate source regions. This analysis suggests that camera networks should be optimized for the largest possible number of meteorite recoveries with measured speed precisions of order 0.1 km/s.},

Twelve of the ﬁfteen non-fragmenting meteoroids had luminous eﬃciencies less than 1\%, while the fragmenting meteoroids had upper limits of a few tens of percent. No clear trend with speed was seen, but there was a weak negative trend of luminous eﬃciency on meteoroid mass, implying that smaller meteoroids radiate more eﬃciently.},

Whilst it is often imagined that small meteoroids are predominantly derived from comets through stream formation, and thus must have comet-like orbits, in fact the majority of observed meteoroid orbits are more similar to those of Apollo and Aten asteroids, with small, low-inclination orbits. In all about 69 000 meteoroid orbits are available from the {IAU} Meteor Data Center in Lund, Sweden, having been measured in various optical and radar observation programs based in the U.S.A., Canada, the former Soviet Union, Somalia, the Czech Republic, Japan, and Australia. Depending upon the detection method used, the original meteoroids producing the observed meteoric phenomena range in size from ∼100 μm to ∼10 cm. Here the raw orbital, radiant and speed distributions are presented for the major surveys, a common format being used so that they may be intercompared such that general conclusions may be drawn, and the differences between the survey results identified. These data, collected over the past several decades, provide an important source of information on the origin and evolution of the small bodies in the solar system.},

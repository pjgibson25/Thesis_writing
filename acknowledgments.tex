I would like to thank the following professors for their tremendous support and advice throughout my Willamette experience:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dr.~Jed Rembold for teasing me and providing me with Hershey's Kisses as a consolation for his hate.
    \item Dr.~Rick Watkins for telling me "You got this!" in trying times.
    \item Dr.~Daniel Borrero, Dr.~Michaela Kleinart, Dr.~David Altman for their kindness and unwavering confidence in our graduating class.
\end{itemize}

I would also so like to thank the following people for helping me through countless homework problems, talking down my problems, and also picking on me when I deserve it:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Trent Jones for being a below par friend and an above par golfer.
    \item Jo Stensass for serving me all sorts of help along the way and providing a willingness to set me up for success.
    \item The wizards who answer questions on Stack Overflow and spend time editing Wikipedia to make it a more reliable resource.
    \item Not only to God but to Jesus.
\end{itemize}

Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, I would like to thank my mother and father for their unconditional love and for providing me with countless wonderful life opportunities such as the entirety of my college experience.  There is no argument that I would not be at this point without them.
